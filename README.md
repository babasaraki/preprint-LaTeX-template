# preprint-LaTeX-template

## Overview
A LaTeX template designed to make it easier to produce experimental report preprints prior to sending to journals such as [J. Neurosci, PNAS, frontiers, cell, Trends Cogn. Sci]. This template has been adapted from the standard open source PNAS LaTeX class template found [here](http://www.pnas.org/page/authors/latex).

The template copies preprint formats found on the following sites:
* [psyarxiv](https://psyarxiv.com)
* [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org)

The template design is based on the following preprint papers:
[1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/12/247460)
[2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/19/268045)
[3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/15/234070)

## Motivation
Recently, authors in the timing and decision making literatures are publishing experimental reports to either psyarxiv or biorxiv prior to them being accepted by a journal. They are using generic report templates to do this that look clean and should allow the fast reversioning into different journal templates. The motivation for this repository is to a) copy their style and b) decrease report production time prior to targetting a journal.

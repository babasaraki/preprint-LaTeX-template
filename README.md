# preprint-LaTeX-template

## Overview
A LaTeX template designed to make it faster and easier to produce experimental report preprints prior to experimental articles being sent to journals such as (J. Neurosci, PNAS, frontiers, cell, Trends Cogn. Sci). This template has been adapted from the standard open source PNAS LaTeX template found [here](http://www.pnas.org/page/authors/latex).

The template style copies preprint formats found on the following sites:
[psyarxiv](https://psyarxiv.com)
[biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org)

The template design is based on the following preprint papers:
[1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/12/247460)
[2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/19/268045)
[3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/15/234070)
[4](https://psyarxiv.com/svf6c/)

## Motivation
There appears to be a recent trend of authors in the timing & decision making literature publishing papers to either psyarxiv or biorxiv prior to being accepted by traditional journals.

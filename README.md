# preprint-LaTeX-template

## Overview
A LaTeX template designed to make it easier and faster to produce experimental report preprints prior to sending to journals such as [J. Neurosci, PNAS, frontiers, cell, Trends Cogn. Sci]. This template has been adapted from the standard open source PNAS LaTeX template found [here](http://www.pnas.org/page/authors/latex).

The template copies preprint formats found on the following sites:
* <a href="https://psyarxiv.com" target="_blank">psyarxiv</a>
* <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org" target="_blank">biorxiv</a>

The template design is based on the following preprint papers:
[1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/12/247460)
[2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/19/268045)
[3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/15/234070)

## Motivation
Recently, authors in the timing & decision making literature are publishing experimental reports to either psyarxiv or biorxiv prior to them being accepted by a journal.
